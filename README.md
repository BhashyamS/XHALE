In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital world, over 60% of individuals recognize that their physical environment significantly influences their productivity, expressing a strong desire for more adaptable workspaces. Traditional solutions, such as online focus rooms, often fail to fully immerse the user, offering limited customization and lacking the sensory depth needed to truly enhance focus and productivity. 

Our XR app, Xhale, addresses this gap by providing a customizable, immersive room experience, allowing users to select environments that best suit their needs for concentration and well-being. This personalized approach not only enhances productivity but also makes the experience of concentration more enjoyable and effective.
